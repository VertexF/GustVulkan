# The Gust Engine - Vulkan Edition

This is the Gust engine https://github.com/VertexF/Gust with the Vulkan tutorial code running on top of it found here https://vulkan-tutorial.com/ this was my first attempt learning Vulkan. This engine is no longer in development a lot of this game engine source code is a new engine I'm developing privately. I keep semi-regular updates on my game development journey on my YouTube channel [EscPointDev](https://www.youtube.com/@EscPointDev) 
So if you are more interested in further details about what I'm doing and I'm doing check out a video.
